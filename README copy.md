A very basic terraform example showing how to do cross-account (between account, that is) s3 replication with datasync.

datasync is one of the methods for s3 bucket replication.

Optionally allowing you to switch between source or destination for the tasks.

Example provided because I could find no good examples.

Someone, please, turn this into a module ? :-)

Thanks

Alex
